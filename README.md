# deep-learning

built deep learning models for classification

1) - blood_cell_classification
     classifying and detecting the image data into its type of blood cell using deep learning model ( transfer learning )
     MODEL :- 
     * vgg16
    
2) - eye_abnormalities_classification 
     A comparision between the simple baseline and feature extraction and fine tuning methods of the same model for classifying the type of eye abnormality for which purely augmented dataset is used.
     MODEL :-
     * baseline 
     * vgg19-feature extraction 
     * vgg19-fine tuning
